_With ethnic tension and related issues of privilege, equity and structural discrimination making news on campuses and in communities around the nation, many organizations are considering “cultural competency” programs. Yet cultural competence is itself a problematic concept. In this session, we introduce the concept of cultural humility, an alternative to cultural competence that comes from the medical fields, explore how it differs from competence and its potential benefits to libraries of all kinds._
